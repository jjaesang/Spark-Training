Apache Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system.
It provides high-level APIs in Java, Scala, Python and R, and an optimized engine that supports general execution graphs.
It also supports a rich set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and structured data processing, MLlib for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming.
Security in Spark is OFF by default.
This could mean you are vulnerable to attack by default.
Please see Spark Security before downloading and running Spark
Get Spark from the downloads page of the project website.
This documentation is for Spark version 2.4.1.
Spark uses Hadoop’s client libraries for HDFS and YARN.
Downloads are pre-packaged for a handful of popular Hadoop versions.
Users can also download a “Hadoop free” binary and run Spark with any Hadoop version by augmenting Spark’s classpath.
Scala and Java users can include Spark in their projects using its Maven coordinates and in the future Python users can also install Spark from PyPI.
